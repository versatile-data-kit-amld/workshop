## EV Range Prediction
We would use linear regression to calculate the range we can drive under given meteorological conditions and speed.
We would create a data driven application powered by a data science project. We would demonstrate how we can sustainably move our POC data science projects into production-ready products.
### Launch Workshop 1

## Covid vs. No Scent Complaints
Ispired by a Twitter post, we would investigate whether there is a connection between Covid cases in the US and complaints raised for one Amazon product.
We would go through the whole data science workflow from obtaining the data, cleaning it, doing a correlation analysis and building a data-driven application that is being updated regularly. And this would be achieved with minimal additional effort than running the analysis in POC.
### Launch Workshop 2

## Investigating Covid Cases
We are going to build a data application that would track Covid cases.
### Launch Workshop 3
!!!Comming Soon!!!
